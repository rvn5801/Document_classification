This document is the final project report for Group 25, titled "Automated Document Classification using Hierarchical Taxonomy with LLMs". The report outlines the development of a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for taxonomy enrichment and document classification with minimal supervision. The project aims to automate taxonomy construction and enhance classification processes, achieving high accuracy and scalability.

Key Highlights:
Objective: Develop a semi-automated system for taxonomy enrichment and document classification using LLMs.

Methodology: Utilizes models like roberta-large-mnli, bert-base-uncased, and all-MiniLM-L6-v2 for core class annotation, taxonomy enrichment, and text classification.

Implementation: Integrated with AWS services (S3, Lambda, OpenSearch) for scalable and real-time document processing and retrieval.

Results: Achieved over 73% accuracy in classification tasks, with significant improvements in taxonomy enrichment compared to traditional methods.

Future Work: Includes exploring unsupervised learning, optimizing scalability, and expanding applicability to industries like healthcare and finance.
